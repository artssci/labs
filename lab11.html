              illustration software like Adobe Illustrator. Vector artwork is built from vector graphics, which are images created with
              mathematical formulas. <br> <br> The SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics) file format is a popular tool for displaying two-dimensional graphics, charts, and illustrations 
              on websites. Plus, as a vector file, it can be scaled up or down without losing any of its resolution. <b>The monster below

             <i class="fa fa-quote-left" style="font-size:48px"></i> Scalable Vector Graphics have come a 
              long way in recent years — but what are SVGs used for in practice?
              Designers often use SVGs to display website icons like buttons, as well as company logos. 
              This file type’s ability to scale up or down without ever compromising its quality means
              they’re ideal for graphics that need to appear in multiple places and in a range of sizes.

              hugely popular with web designers. SVGs are written in XML code, meaning they store any text information as 
              literal text rather than shapes. This allows search engines like Google to read SVG graphics for their keywords, 
              which can potentially help a website move up in search rankings.
