             <i class="fa fa-quote-left" style="font-size:48px"></i> Vector artwork is a term that describes any art made with vector 
              illustration software like Adobe Illustrator. Vector artwork is built from vector graphics, which are images created with
              mathematical formulas. In comparison, raster art (also referred to as bitmaps or raster images) is created with colorized 
              pixels. Enlarge pixel-based art in a raster file too much and it looks jaggy, whereas you can enlarge vector art to any size
              without negatively affecting its appearance. This resolution independence allows vector art to be used in a variety of forms, 
              from small illustrations to massive billboards.

              composition when they create advertisements, websites, or anything else that features careful organization of

              illustrators, or they sometimes produce vector art of their own for the designs. A designer may create a vector-based
              design that incorporates many different pieces of vector artwork.
